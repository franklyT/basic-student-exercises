# mastermind-ruby-cli

A game of Mastermind coded in ruby.

This was an excellent task to work effectively in OOP. Even a simple game requires a lot of deft project structuring, and, even though I don't believe I perfectly executed the design of an absolutely optimal program, I feel that I was able to make it readable.
